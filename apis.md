description: In a world that is becoming increasingly more visual, the ability to
  find and use images effectively gives communications professionals a competitive
  advantage. Cutcaster has tapped into a new creative universe of unique photos and
  vector illustrations that can be purchased royalty free for use in publishing, web
  design project, printing brochures, advertising, corporate marketing, electronic
  usage on websites and presentations. Cutcaster is the first model that adds a dynamic
  marketplace structure to support licensing user-generated photography and vectors.
  If you don&#8217;t have the budget or time to create the content yourself and want
  to find the most original, highest quality and authentic content not previously
  available to license and within your budget, then join us for free at Cutcaster.Sellers
  have the flexibility to set their prices or those new to the world of licensing
  can use the Cutcaster Algorithm to determine a fair market price for them. There
  are many ways to purchase photos and vectors from Cutcaster. Buyers can browse the
  growing Cutcaster image library, download comps, buy credits, sign up for corporate
  accounts, add images and vectors to their shopping cart without registering and
  immediately download content when they need it. In addition, buyers, if they choose,
  can seamlessly name their price by bidding on the photos or illustrations, which
  a seller can quickly accept, decline or submit a new offer back.  If we don&#8217;t
  have what you are looking for or you can&#8217;t find it anywhere during your search,
  you can request custom content and set a deadline in the ProjectRequest area on
  the homepage and give our amazing user-base the opportunity to &#8220;wow&#8221;
  you with fresh, authentic and timely content.
